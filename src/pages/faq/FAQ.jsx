      question: "Why isn't an episode showing in my statistics?",

    },
    {
      question: "What does 'Completion Rate' mean?",

    },
    {

    },
    {
      question: "Why do I see comments about other websites in the comment section?",
      answer: "The comment section is a global chat system used by multiple anime streaming sites worldwide. Since it's shared across different platforms, you may see discussions or complaints about other websites that also use this comment service. This is normal for a global community chat system."
    },
    {
      question: "Who provides the comment service?",
      answer: "The comment section is powered by The Anime Community, an independent third-party service. They provide comment functionality for anime websites globally. Otazumi integrates with their service to enable community discussions."
